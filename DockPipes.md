# DockPipes

## Introduction

Create a pipeline to quickly and effortlessly (at least once everything is up and running) screen large libraries of ligands. This would be achieved by running bash scripts (docking in AutoDock), then integrating the results of the docking in KNIME (e.g. by taking the resulting .csv files from the fitting of the ligands). From here, we can manipulate the data, visualize it and decide how to proceed for the future of this project. Interesting avenues/ideas will be in the future ideas section of the document.
